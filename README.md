# Carbon Client

This simple carbon client is able to send data via

* the plaintext
* the pickle

protocol into carbon.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need to install a python few modules, including:

* socket
* struct
* cPickle
* sys

## Usage

Example for the plaintext protocol:

	import time
	from carbon_client import CarbonClient
	
	carbon = CarbonClient(args.carbon_host, args.carbon_port)

	carbon.send_plaintext(name, float(value), int( time.time() ))

Example for the pickle protocol:

	import time
	from carbon_client import CarbonClient
	
	carbon = CarbonClient(args.carbon_host, args.carbon_port)
	
	pickle = []
	
	now = int( time.time() )
	
	pickle.append(name1, (now, str( value1 )))
	pickle.append(name2, (now, str( value2 )))
	
	carbon.send_pickle(pickle)
